                <h4>5 out of 5 stars</h4>
                From the quality stitching to the vibrant colors, these horse blankets are the bee's knees!

            <div class="review2">
                <h4>Will Buy Again</h4>
                I have 3 of these horse blankets and will definately be buying more. They are sturdy and long lasting, my
                oldest one is 5 years old and it is barely fraying from weekly use.

            <div class="review3">
                <h4>Quality!</h4>
                My dog is ruff and tumble, always getting into new adventures no matter the terrain (we hang out in the
                forest a lot). These coats have lasted some extreme weather and extreme play. I cannot say enough great
                things about these coats!
