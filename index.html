                    I have 3 of these horse blankets and will definately be buying more. They are sturdy and long lasting, my
                    oldest one is 5 years old and it is barely fraying from weekly use.

                    My dog is ruff and tumble, always getting into new adventures no matter the terrain (we hang out in the
                    forest a lot). These coats have lasted some extreme weather and extreme play. I cannot say enough great
                    things about these coats!
